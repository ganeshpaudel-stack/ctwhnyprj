<h1><center>About  Chitwan  Honey Nepal</center></h1>

<p>
Pure Honey Nepal was founded with the goal of promoting natural honey and supporting 
local beekeepers. We work with farmers from various regions of Nepal, especially from 
hilly and mountainous areas where bees naturally produce high-quality honey. Our 
organization focuses on sustainability, fair pricing, and spreading awareness about 
the health benefits of raw honey. We believe that pure honey should be accessible to 
everyone and that traditional beekeeping practices must be preserved for future 
generations.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>
Our mission is to deliver pure, unprocessed, and chemical-free honey directly to 
customers while supporting small beekeepers. We aim to promote healthy living, 
encourage natural foods, and strengthen Nepal’s beekeeping community.
